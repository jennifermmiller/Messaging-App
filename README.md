Messaging-App
=============

This was our first Iron Yard assignment that included Parse.com as a back-end. It was primarily completed in the course of one weekend. The app's main features include a user login and a messaging board.

Other tools used to build it include Underscore, Backbone, SASS, Bootstrap, and Momentjs.
